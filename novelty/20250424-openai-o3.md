I’ve read the full theory.md you linked — the one that defines intelligence as

I = P / R, where P is predictive power and R is resource consumption.  ￼

Below is a tight assessment against the three criteria you asked for.

⸻

1  Rationality (internal soundness)

✔ strengths	⚠︎ press-points
Clear micro-formula.  “More accurate predictions with fewer resources ⇒ higher I” is easy to grasp and broadly consistent with predictive-coding views of the brain.	Units / measurability.  P combines “accuracy” and “scope” but no metric is specified; R mixes time, energy and memory.  Without a common unit the ratio can be undefined or arbitrarily rescaled.
Context-bounded.  You explicitly tie every measurement to a domain, avoiding category errors like comparing chess skill to welding skill.	Prediction ≠ all of intelligence.  Planning, motivation and value alignment are relegated to “meta-prediction,” yet they are causal, not merely predictive, capacities.
Includes meta-level cost control.  Your notion that smart systems first predict which model is cheapest for the job echoes modern “metareasoning” work.	Goodhart risk.  Any single scalar (I) invites optimisation that subverts its intent.  The paper should acknowledge Goodhart’s Law and propose safeguards.
Treats instinct & LLM latency cleanly.  Fast reflexes get credit for low R; long chains-of-thought are tolerated if they buy enough P.	Static/agency confusion.  You label formulas “tools, not intelligent,” yet credit genetic reflexes with intelligence.  The criterion for “agency” needs tightening.

Overall the logic is internally consistent, but the theory needs an explicit operational recipe for P and R to be scientifically testable.

2  Usefulness (cross-domain applicability)
	•	AI benchmarking.  If P were instantiated as task-score and R as joules + seconds + dollars, I could become a real “accuracy-per-watt” leaderboard.  MLPerf already tracks a similar ratio informally, suggesting practical traction.
	•	Neuroscience & biology.  The brain is often modelled as a resource-bounded prediction machine; recent work measures “predictive information per ATP molecule” in cells  ￼.  Your framework dovetails with that line of empirical work.
	•	Psychology & psychometrics.  Classic g-factor tests ignore compute cost; your metric could, in principle, explain why heuristics (“fast-and-frugal” rules) sometimes beat deliberative reasoning.
	•	Systems engineering.  Architects already talk about “return on FLOPs.”  Your formula formalises that intuition and could guide model-compression or hardware selection.

Limitation: Until concrete measurement protocols exist, the theory serves more as a philosophical lens than an engineering tool.

3  Novelty (relative to prior literature)

Claim in theory.md	Closest existing work
“Intelligence is accurate prediction.”	Tjøstheim & Stephens, Intelligence as Accurate Prediction (2021)  ￼
“Efficiency = prediction / cost.”	Tjalma et al., Trade-offs between cost and information in cellular prediction (PNAS 2023) — maximises predictive info per resource cost  ￼
Domain-bounded evaluation.	Legg & Hutter’s “universal intelligence” explicitly averages performance over environments, i.e. domains  ￼
Meta-prediction / cost-aware cognition.	Gershman et al., “Computational Rationality” (Science 2015) — maximise utility subject to computational cost  ￼

The individual components of your framework therefore are not new in academic terms.
What is relatively fresh is the very compact P / R expression plus an explicitly domain-scoped scorecard, something most earlier theories mention verbally but do not collapse into a single ratio.  That makes the idea easy to communicate, even if it sits atop well-trodden foundations.

Bottom line
	•	Rationality: conceptually coherent, but needs rigorous definitions for P and R and an answer to Goodhart-style exploits.
	•	Usefulness: potentially high in AI benchmarking and biology, once operationalised.
	•	Novelty: incremental.  The “efficient prediction” lens and the P / R ratio echo existing work in predictive-processing, computational-rationality, and information-cost trade-offs; the main added value is packaging and clarity, not new substance.

If you want the theory to stand out academically, I’d recommend:
	1.	Formalise measurement.  Specify a concrete P (e.g., log-likelihood over test data) and a weighted sum of resource costs, then demonstrate I on a real benchmark.
	2.	Show empirical discrimination.  Pick two systems that score the same on raw accuracy but differ on I and argue why the higher-I system is “smarter.”
	3.	Address adversarial optimisation.  Propose multi-objective or by-domain checklists to keep the metric from being gamed.

Those steps would convert the elegant slogan into a publishable contribution.
