# Theory of Intelligence as Efficient Prediction

## Introduction

This theory proposes a meta-definition of intelligence that encompasses all common definitions under one umbrella. By focusing solely on outcomes and efficiency, while remaining untied to specific models of cognition, it provides a universal framework for understanding intelligence in any form.

## Core Definition

Intelligence is a measure of efficient prediction in a system within a given context.

This can be expressed mathematically as:
**I = P/R**

where:
- **I** is Intelligence
- **P** is Predictive Power (accuracy and scope of predictions)
- **R** is Resource Consumption (effort, energy, time, etc.)

This formulation captures several key insights:
1. Higher predictive power increases intelligence
2. Lower resource consumption increases intelligence
3. Simple but accurate predictions (like reflexes) can represent high intelligence due to minimal resource usage
4. Complex predictions may represent lower intelligence if they consume disproportionate resources

This theory is unconcerned with how predictions are made, focusing solely on outcomes and efficiency. Context is inherent in all predictions, making the theory universally applicable across systems, from slime molds and ants to AI, humans, political bodies, and entire civilizations.

## Core Principles

1. **Predictive Power as the Essence of Intelligence**
   - Intelligence is defined by the ability to anticipate outcomes effectively across domains

2. **Efficiency as an Essential Measure**
   - Intelligent systems maximize accuracy while minimizing resource use
   - Intelligence isn't simply about being correct—it's about achieving correctness efficiently

3. **Meta-Intelligence**
   - Intelligence includes predicting which models or approaches will yield the best results for the least effort

4. **Scalability and Universality**
   - The theory applies at every level of complexity, from simple organisms to complex systems
   - Intelligence can be evaluated independent of underlying mechanisms

5. **Outcome-Based Evaluation**
   - Intelligence is measured purely by predictive outcomes achieved within a given context

## Implications

1. **Unified Framework**: Predictive capacity unifies diverse forms of intelligence by framing them as context-specific prediction systems

2. **Dynamic and Adaptive Intelligence**: Intelligent systems must balance predictive accuracy and resource use

3. **Applications Across Systems**: The theory applies universally to biological, artificial, and social systems

## Assumptions & Constraints

1. **Core Assumptions**
   - Prediction is fundamental to all forms of intelligence
   - Efficiency is measurable relative to task complexity
   - Context is inherent in all predictions

2. **Theoretical Scope**
   - Applies to any system capable of prediction
   - Independent of specific mechanisms or implementations
   - Focused on outcomes rather than processes

## Note on Mental Models

The mechanism by which systems achieve prediction (e.g., through mental models) is explored in a separate theory. This theory remains agnostic to mechanisms, focusing purely on measuring intelligence through predictive efficiency (I = P/R).
