# Timescales: control vs adaptation

Two timescales prevent confusion when comparing systems:

## Control timescale
How fast the system can act using its current “model/policy.”

## Adaptation timescale (τ)
How fast the system can change its model/policy in a durable way.

## Examples

- Calculator: very fast control, τ = infinite (no learning)
- Mechanical policy device: fast control, τ = infinite (unless redesigned)
- Tree: moderate control behaviors, τ = generational
- Human: fast control and deliberation, τ = days to years
- Trained model (inference-only): fast control, τ = retraining cycle

## Why this matters

- It lets you recognize “intelligence” in systems with no agency or learning (high control competence in narrow envelopes).
- It prevents “learning speed” from being conflated with “performance speed.”
