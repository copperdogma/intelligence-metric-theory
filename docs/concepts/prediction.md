# What Counts as Prediction?

## The Broader Question

Prediction exists far beyond explicit cognitive processes. This document explores what counts as prediction across different system types.

## Non-Cognitive Prediction

### Trees and Evolution

Trees demonstrate prediction at evolutionary timescales:
- **Stomata control**: Predicting when to open/close based on environmental conditions to optimize water use
- **Leaf orientation**: Predicting optimal angles for sunlight capture
- **Root growth**: Predicting where nutrients will be available
- **Seasonal responses**: Predicting seasonal changes and preparing accordingly

Evolution itself encodes predictive power:
- Genetic intelligence represents near-zero resource prediction
- Evolutionary processes encode predictive power without active computation
- Organisms carry forward successful predictive strategies across generations

### Mechanical Systems

Even purely mechanical systems can demonstrate prediction:
- **Mechanical tic-tac-toe solver**: Predicts optimal moves through physical structure
- **Thermostats**: Predict when heating/cooling is needed
- **Automatic doors**: Predict when to open based on sensor input

These systems compile predictions into structure rather than computing them online.

### Compiled vs Simulated Prediction

**Compiled/evolved/mechanical**:
- Predictions encoded in structure, reflexes, or evolved behaviors
- Very high efficiency (low R) but limited flexibility
- Examples: instincts, morphology, mechanisms, lookup tables

**Simulated**:
- Predictions computed through active model execution
- More flexible but typically higher resource cost
- Examples: human reasoning, AI model inference, explicit planning

## Forecasting vs Prediction-Under-Intervention

### Forecasting (Passive)
- Predicting what will happen given current conditions
- No action required, just observation
- Example: Weather forecasting, stock market trends

### Prediction-Under-Intervention (Active)
- Predicting consequences of actions
- Requires understanding how actions affect outcomes
- Example: Car dashboard (predicting consequences of steering/braking), medical treatment planning

Most practical intelligence requires prediction-under-intervention.

## Examples Across Systems

### Biological Systems

**Slime Molds**:
- Demonstrate basic predictive intelligence through nutrient-seeking behavior
- Efficiently allocate resources based on environmental cues
- Compiled prediction through chemical gradient following

**Ant Colonies**:
- Exhibit collective intelligence through resource allocation
- Outperform humans in certain collective decision-making tasks
- Distributed prediction across many simple agents

### Artificial Systems

**The Chinese Room**:
- Task-specific intelligence through symbol manipulation
- Demonstrates intelligence without understanding
- Efficient prediction within defined context through lookup

**Machine Intelligence**:
- Creates models surpassing human comprehension
- Evaluated by predictive outcomes, not internal processes
- Demonstrates theory's applicability beyond human understanding

### Simple Autonomous Systems

**Roombas**:
- Demonstrate basic predictive intelligence through navigation
- Resource usage is minimal for simple environmental predictions
- Efficiency achieved through specialized, limited-scope intelligence

## Instincts and Reflexes

Even instinctual behaviors in simple organisms are forms of prediction:
- **Reflexes**: Pre-computed responses to stimuli (compiled prediction)
- **Instincts**: Evolved behavioral patterns that predict successful outcomes
- Demonstrates that predictive intelligence exists on a spectrum

These represent high intelligence (high P/R) through minimal resource usage, even if the scope is narrow.

## Intuitive Insights

Intuition is subconscious pattern recognition—predictions based on learned experience:
- Predictions don't need to be explicitly logical to be intelligent
- Subconscious prediction can be highly efficient
- Often represents compiled prediction from extensive experience

## Static vs Dynamic Systems

**Static systems** (formulas, mechanical devices):
- Are tools rather than intelligent entities
- True intelligence requires agency and feedback loops
- Systems become intelligent when combined with agents that utilize them

**Dynamic systems**:
- Can adapt and improve predictions over time
- Feedback loops enable learning and refinement
- Demonstrate intelligence through improving P/R ratio

## Key Insights

1. **Prediction is universal**: Exists across all system types, from mechanical to biological to artificial
2. **Implementation varies**: Can be compiled, simulated, or hybrid
3. **Scope matters**: Prediction can be narrow (reflexes) or broad (human reasoning)
4. **Efficiency counts**: Compiled predictions often achieve higher I through lower R
5. **Context is everything**: What counts as prediction depends on the envelope
