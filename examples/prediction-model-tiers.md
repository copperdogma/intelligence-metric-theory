# Prediction Model Tiers: A Cost-Benefit Framework

## Overview
Mental models used for prediction can be understood as a stepped gradient, where each tier represents a different trade-off between resource consumption (R) and predictive power (P). The "best" model for a given situation depends on the intelligence metric I = P/R, not on the sophistication of the underlying mechanism.

Note that these tiers are arbitrary and simply one way to think about the trade-off between resource consumption and predictive power.


## Three-Tier Framework

### Tier 1: Statistical Patterns
**Mechanism**: Simple pattern detection and expectation of continuity
**Characteristics**:
- Often subconscious
- No understanding of underlying "why"
- Minimal resource consumption
- Effective for stable, repetitive contexts

**Example**: "You cross the street at a crosswalk."

### Tier 2: Conditional Heuristics
**Mechanism**: Recognition of exceptions with rule-based processing
**Characteristics**:
- Often subconscious
- Crude conditional logic
- Hints at causation without deep understanding
- Moderate resource consumption

**Example**: "IF the light says walk AND IF there are no cars coming, you can safely cross the street."

### Tier 3: First Principles Models
**Mechanism**: Deep understanding of priors, constraints, and underlying mechanisms
**Characteristics**:
- Usually conscious
- Resilient to novel situations
- Adaptable across contexts
- High resource consumption during construction
- Enables reasoning in unpredicted scenarios

**Example**: Understanding traffic systems well enough to navigate safely across different countries, weather conditions, physical constraints (crutches/wheelchairs), while helping others, etc.

## Intelligence Implications

### Resource Efficiency
- Lower-tier models are not inherently inferior
- Simpler models often represent higher intelligence (I = P/R) when:
  - Predictive accuracy is sufficient for the context
  - Resource costs would exceed value of deeper understanding
  - Underlying mechanisms are unknowable or irrelevant

### When Higher Tiers Are Necessary
- Novel situations outside training data
- High-stakes contexts requiring resilient predictions
- Environments with rapidly changing constraints
- Cross-domain applications requiring adaptation

### Meta-Intelligence Consideration
Choosing the appropriate tier for a given situation is itself a meta-prediction that demonstrates intelligence: predicting which level of model provides the best P/R ratio for the current context.
