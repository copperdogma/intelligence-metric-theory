### Extended cognition / “Extended mind” (Clark & Chalmers)
Core idea: cognition can include **external artifacts** (notes, tools, environment) as part of the cognitive system.

- PDF: https://www.alice.id.tue.nl/references/clark-chalmers-1998.pdf

### Distributed cognition (Hutchins)
Core idea: the cognitive unit of analysis can be **a team + artifacts + procedures**, not an individual mind.

### Ecological Interface Design (EID) (Vicente & Rasmussen)
Core idea: interface design for complex systems should reduce unnecessary cognitive work and support skill/rule/knowledge control levels (SRK); **don’t force higher-level processing than the task requires**.

### Situation Awareness (Endsley)
Core idea: SA has levels (commonly summarized as **perception → comprehension → projection**), and SA is a key bottleneck in dynamic, time-critical tasks.

### Bounded rationality (Herbert Simon)
Core idea: rationality is limited by **information and computation constraints**; agents “satisfice” under limits.

### Rational inattention (Sims)

### Information-theoretic bounded rationality (Ortega, Braun, et al.)

### Cybernetics / Control theory (Wiener)
Core idea: **control and communication** in animals and machines; feedback loops, stability, and regulation—highly compatible with “prediction under intervention” framing.

### Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)
Core idea: working memory is limited; instructional/interface design should minimize **extraneous load** (pure overhead).
