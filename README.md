# Intelligence as Efficient Prediction

A theoretical framework proposing that intelligence is fundamentally about achieving accurate predictions with minimal necessary effort, relative to task complexity and stakes. This meta-definition aims to unify diverse forms of intelligence under a single, measurable framework.

## Project Goals

1. **Establish Novelty**: Demonstrate unique theoretical contribution
   - Integration of efficiency and prediction
   - Universal applicability across systems
   - Resource-independent measurement framework

2. **Demonstrate Utility**: Show practical applications
   - Cross-system intelligence comparison
   - Predictive efficiency metrics
   - Real-world case studies

3. **Academic Impact**: Share findings
   - Academic paper development
   - Theoretical refinement
   - Community engagement
